This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in PHP involving recursive array processing and unexpected behavior when dealing with string values containing commas within nested arrays. The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.  The bug occurs in the handling of nested arrays where a string value is split using explode, resulting in unintended changes to the array structure if nested arrays are present.
